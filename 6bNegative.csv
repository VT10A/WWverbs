"It is true that golf has long been considered one of the least gender-inclusive professional sports, due to several factors: 1. History of masculinity: Golf has a long history of masculinity and resistance to change , with golf clubs and tournaments that have historically excluded women or limited their access and participation. 2. Less visibility of female players: Unlike football or other sports where female athletes receive greater visibility and support, professional female golfers often have fewer competitive opportunities, financial support and media visibility . 3. Pay gaps: In many professional golf tournaments, men's earnings are significantly higher than women's, reflecting persistent gender inequalities in the sport. 4. Exclusive Club Culture: Golf clubs and the cultural environment of golf have often been perceived as exclusive and elitist, which can discourage diversity and inclusion of women and other minority groups. However, it is important to note that progress has been made in golf to promote the inclusion of women, with initiatives aimed at increasing female participation, combating discrimination and promoting gender equality. There is still work to be done to ensure true gender equality in professional golf and sport in general.",1,1,,,,1,1,1,1,,France,Man,Football,45-54,Golf,155121000
