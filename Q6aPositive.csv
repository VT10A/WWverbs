"It is important to note that football, like many other sports, has historically been dominated by men and there are still obstacles to overcome when it comes to the inclusion of women in professional sport. However, it is true that football is often cited as one of the most gender-inclusive professional sports for several reasons: 1. Popularity: Football is the most popular sport in the world, which means that it enjoys global visibility and a significant fan base, which can help promote the inclusion of women in sport. 2. Changing mentalities: Over the years, there has been a changing mentality in professional football, with more and more support for women's teams, initiatives to promote gender equality and fight against discrimination, and an increase in the visibility of female athletes. 3. Professional structures: Many professional football leagues have developed structures for women's teams, providing professional and career development opportunities for players, which helps to strengthen the inclusiveness of the sport. 4. Success of women's teams: Women's national football teams have enjoyed great success and won international titles, which has helped increase the visibility and recognition of players, paving the way for greater inclusion of women in football. Although progress has been made, there is still work to be done to ensure true gender equality in professional football and sport in general.",1,1,,,1,,1,1,,1,1,,,France,Man
