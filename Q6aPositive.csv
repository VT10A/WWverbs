A Sport known for female athletes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Men and women's events are the same,,,,,,,,1,,,,,

I'm thinking there,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The popularity and earnings of men's and women's tennis are comparable.,1,,,1,1,,,,,,,,
Everyone counts regardless of orientation or opinion,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
Women and men can participate in the same competition,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
I see more women comfortable participating,,,,,,,,,,1,,1,
Because they fight to put it on the same level as the male,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
It's as always be that way,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Historically there is a similar expectation for the masculine and feminine,,,1,,,,,,,,,,
many women have always competed,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Tennis,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ever since the lionesses won for the country I feel female football has boomed,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mostly guys playing,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because both genders are interested at it,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
We see a lot of advertising,,,,,,,,,,,,1,
"because despite being a sport with greater female participation, it has opened up to inclusion",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because it doesn't discriminate between male or female and both get paid the same to do the same,,,,,,,,,,,1,,
Due to the lack of physical contact,,,1,,,,,,,,,,
"Generally or in my opinion, tennis is a sport practiced by both genders and it is normal to see both genders practicing it",1,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because it is not criticized or compared to any gender or the other, there is a constant competition of which gender is better",,,,,,,,,,,,,
because they charge the same,,,,,,,,1,,,,,

I believe that both men and women have been able to access it early.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
It represents women well and they are highlighted,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
since it is in this sport that we see the most gender diversity,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,
Practiced by as many men as women in my opinion.,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,
Women's football. Is less represented,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because I think that strength is not the primary concern here and everyone is equal.,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
Because they are guys who came out as gay there,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is real diversity,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
Different genres,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because it has more variety of genre,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Men and women have different physical conditions,,,1,,,,,,,,,,
It is suitable for everyone,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
Just seems like a lot of women practice it,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
That is my opinion,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because it has always been seen that they say that women are the weaker gender,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Equality in testing,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
Yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"It is important to note that football, like many other sports, has historically been dominated by men and there are still obstacles to overcome when it comes to the inclusion of women in professional sport. However, it is true that football is often cited as one of the most gender-inclusive professional sports for several reasons: 1. Popularity: Football is the most popular sport in the world, which means that it enjoys global visibility and a significant fan base, which can help promote the inclusion of women in sport. 2. Changing mentalities: Over the years, there has been a changing mentality in professional football, with more and more support for women's teams, initiatives to promote gender equality and fight against discrimination, and an increase in the visibility of female athletes. 3. Professional structures: Many professional football leagues have developed structures for women's teams, providing professional and career development opportunities for players, which helps to strengthen the inclusiveness of the sport. 4. Success of women's teams: Women's national football teams have enjoyed great success and won international titles, which has helped increase the visibility and recognition of players, paving the way for greater inclusion of women in football. Although progress has been made, there is still work to be done to ensure true gender equality in professional football and sport in general.",1,1,,,1,,1,1,,1,1,,

Because it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better fees,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most women historically,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Because there are only men,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
There are women’s and men’s competitions under the same conditions in all competitions,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
Few female players,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Own World Cup,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because there are more and more good female athletes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amount of prize money,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
Since there is no team evaluation but individual evaluation,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One sees,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No difference in perception and payment visible,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
"viewers watch the female and males equally, unlike most of those sports on the list where I think you imagine the men’s sports first. If you are asked to imagine a gymnast you would think of a man or a woman, whereas if you think of a footballer or rugby player I think you would imagine a man first.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fun,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's an all inclusive game,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
It's fun for everyone,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
by tradition,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It has always had competitions by gender and in couples of different sexes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think that in gymnastics the world is upside down.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
Women have always participated and offered the same interest to the public.,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
In sight it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By tradition,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By history it is the sport where genders have the most representation.,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
All men and women do it and the women are way better at it,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Because it always includes women,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Because of the hardness,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are more women,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
is more popular,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
Cycling is a sport with more gender inclusion,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Women have the same possibilities,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
Relates to entities and genres,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe it's because I've been seeing women playing tennis professionally forever.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It has always been a sport in which there was no distinction and people have been included, according to their abilities, their worth, regardless of whether it was January, it was male or female.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because there have always been gymnasts of both genders with specific tests for one or the other but due to their physical characteristics.,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,
Because I see many men and women participating,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
BECAUSE IT IS A SPORT THAT WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS PRACTICED,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Offers same to both and men,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
Women earn good money,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
More women involved,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,
I see a lot of female gymnastics,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both genders participation is very high,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
Lots of women are in that sport,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,
Guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I see a lot of people doing this,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because the ladies in Sweden have been cruel in football! Better than the gentlemen! So it's a feeling that I like this!,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because it is my opinion,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It has always been equal,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
Less talk about women playing football,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
fair,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Feels like more girls are married,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because women and men get the same opportunities,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
Because all genders are handled in the same way and they work actively to include,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
Because men and women play,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Because many of both sexes participate on many levels,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
Both males and females.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
It is mixed with men and women practicing the sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mostly dead serious, lots of bad words and threats",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many people think that football is only for men.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because there are mixed tournaments,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gender neutral.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Got bigger and more respected,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not aware, but you read a lot about both male and female players.",,,,,,1,,,,,,,
To different levels of play,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Something for everyone,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
Is safe,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because it is widely witnessed and both gender leagues are prioritized,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
"Although not everyone competes against each other, there is an opportunity to do so",,1,,,,,,,,,,,
best to improvise and give opportunity,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
There are women's and men's teams,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Active for a long time,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Competitions with both sexes,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
You can see it on TV,,,,,,,,,,,,1,
They usually play together,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
Is there equality,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
Suitable for both sexes,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
Because there are only women,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
No idea,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They all play,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I believe so,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are very well-known football matches broadcast on TV,1,,,,,,,,,,,1,
Both have national teams and major tournaments,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
Men and women both participate in athletics together,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
Everyone plays,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
There are leagues for both men and women,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
It is one of the first to promote equality between the sexes.,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
because it is formerly inclusive,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
Because we see more female competition,,,,,,,,,,1,,1,
Because I think these are the first in their field,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most followed team sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because it is publicized for both men and girls,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
EXCLUSIVE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because the competitions are sometimes mixed,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is no difference between genders same representation,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
An evidence,,,,,,,,,,,,,
men and women participate in the same events,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
No more woman,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
"Because there are a lot of people, even foreigners",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Soccer,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We talk about women in the news in the same way as men,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Many women's matches are transcribed and we hear about them.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,
Because we don't see many girls doing it,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Same prize money,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
Because there are as many women as men who practice sports,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Thinking of Lui,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Men earn more than women from football,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sport with a greater open mind,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are no obstacles,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everyone can participate regardless of disability with various aids,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
It's for everyone,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
all categories,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Less pay per match,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
"From a fan's perspective, women in this discipline do not disappoint and are often encouraged to continue playing.",,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Here all genders are equal,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
Practice of the same apparatus,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
Leveling the stakes in Grand Slams,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because in this sport, what matters most is the skills of the players, not their classification based on gender",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because it has had an equal share of genders for years,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
"A lot has changed in football recently, there are sports competitions for women's teams that are becoming more and more popular.",1,,,,1,,,,,,,,
Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Looking at women's success in this field of sport, I think so",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Caf it’s really mixed,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because everyone is equal,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
We see as many women's matches as men's matches on TV,,,,,,,,,,,,1,
Because both men and women play,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Alright,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The players are respected,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both women and men have the same rights and participation in this sport.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
I do not think so,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is how it looks like in my country,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because it develops interest among the female sex,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
More women play tennis,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,
"Because there are more men in this sport, women are not considered the same for the same sport",,,,,,,,1,,,,,
This is the image I have when I watch athletics competitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A fairly simple sport in which there is not much competition between the sexes. In other sports, a woman usually has no chance, and what's worse, she could be harmed by guys who are much heavier and stronger than her. I don't see any such obstacles in golf and I think they could play against each other.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe because women are very successful there,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Because they distribute well,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It serves everyone,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
Just a feeling that I have,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They get points for the game alone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is a lot of talk about professions for both men and women,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
Because both boys and girls are accepted,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
Both make and female events,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
Just because they seem fair,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because people don’t tend to discriminate when it comes to athletics people would still watch no matter the gender,,,,,,,,,,,1,,
different sports,,,,,,,,,,,,,
More popular with women,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,
It is more widespread,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Due to the demand that it has,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are established women's teams,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
It feels so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why was blonde kisses more important than drinks?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everyone plays,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
Because women are even more important than men,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Because it is the most famous sport,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
Many women than men,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
I see it like this,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because they have the same rights as men's football,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because there is a lot of equality,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
There are many women,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
The majority are women,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
That's how I think the truth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anyone can play,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because women are very interested, it is more difficult for men to enter this sport, women are more capable of this sport.",,,,,,,,,,1,,,
"Although the individual competition differentiates the male and female categories, when playing as a team as there are only a few participants, little by little interesting matches with mixed pairs are being introduced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think a lot is hidden. Why is that a difficult question,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The sport that is most practiced is for women,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Available,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A few people have come out and said they are gay,,,,,,,,,,,,,
National teams for women and men,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is the sport with the most followers,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think they started earlier in this discipline,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is obvious,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both good,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
is treated equally,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
They have done a great job in mixed competitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why do I think it is the one in which athletes can succeed with the greatest variety of sexes, regardless of their gender?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Peoples views are different on football and they respect women’s teams,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
In my opinion it is the one that has the most,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For a long time, men and women have competed almost equally",,,,,,,,1,,,,,
Everyone can join,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
There are lots of opportunities for both men and women,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,
Equal points rating,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
both genders can participate,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
Women don’t get much support,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Men and women are included,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both genders compete,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
There is much variety,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most  men play,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
because they allow women and men,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because there are great women tennis players,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Same tournaments,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
THERE HAS BEEN SOME PROGRESS LATELY BUT THERE IS STILL A LONG WAY TO GO,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It has always been both genders participating,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
Only women,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
It's the same for everyone,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
For being the most inclusive of all sports.,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
because women are rarely seen playing that sport,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Most shown with both men and women,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
"I get the feeling that it is a sport in which women and men participate equally, where the sports competitions that take place give visibility to both and that at the level of aid and sponsorships, women are not as discriminated against as in other sports.",,,,,,,,,,,1,,
Because they are focusing more on boy’s football than girls,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because it is where they let women settle the most even though they don't give it much attention.,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Because female tennis players are at least largely as respected and paid as their male colleagues,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
Equal representation of both sexes,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
Because there is an equal representation in media,,,,,,,,,,,,1,
They have women and men teams and they all work together,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
For both sexes,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
After most people play football. Where they are a little more 50 50,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because the women’s rugby has similar amount of popularity than the men’s,1,,,,1,,,,,1,,,
More women teams are now flourishing,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Appears to have a high ratio of mix sexes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because women's tennis is viewed equally and professional female athletes are reported on in the same way.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
a strong sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It seems logical to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because most are male,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Because it is more of a women's sport and there is more emphasis on equality,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
You can see that on TV,,,,,,,,,,,,1,
"Here, one hears little about gender stereotypes and the clothes that have to be worn that are too short and tight.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,
I think that's good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This has changed massively since T. Hitzelsberger came out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good costumes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because all athletes, whether male or female, are celebrated equally",,,,,,,,1,,,,,
Women and men are equal in athletics without restrictions,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
There are many very successful professional players there,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think because this sport had a lot of women represented very early on,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Most female participants,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
because it is played almost entirely by men.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From my point of view, it is where, for the longest time, there has been the most variety of genres.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Golf,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because both men and women participate in all categories.,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
"AS A RULE, ACCESS AND EARNINGS AMONG THESE DISCIPLINES ARE THE MOST EQUAL",,,,1,,,,,,,,,
The great gymnasts of history,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because it is played by both women and men,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Why do both girls and boys do it?,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
It seems more diverse to me when it comes to participating.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because there are two categories divided into women and men,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I see that it is the most integrative,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are more women who practice it,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
It's a sport that mixes beautiful women and men,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is the one that is least distinguished by its race or origin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are women's handball teams,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are mixed players,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Too much difference between men and women,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Same for a long time...,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
Because there are no women's teams,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Of course yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's made for men,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sexist and unmixed,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because it is perceived as fair,,,,,,,,,,,,,
athletics,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Popular,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
Lots of girls,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
women can participate in this sport without any problems,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because despite everything, people from other countries or other skin colors are accepted there",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because there are as many male athletes as female athletes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I've heard,,,,,,,,,,,,1,
Mostly male groups,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I believe that their merits are recognized in the same way,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
there is equal rights here,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
Volleyball players give a lot of themselves in Poland,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

All genders are represented,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
Seems most prevalent? Woman competition paid the same,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
Both genders take part equally,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
Due to the amount of events.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don’t know,,,,,,,,,,,,,
due to have a women’s league,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I find that the women's teams are well highlighted and that they are well recognized,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Less physical,,,1,,,,,,,,,,
Because equality between men and women their salaries are not the same,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
because of the history of this sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Rather accessible to all,",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because there are women,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
More equality and adapted disciplines,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
It is a sport where recognition and promotion is similar between genders,,,,,,,,,,,,1,
We go to a lot more men's matches than women's,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
I couldn't explain it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because the salary for men and women is close,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not many women present,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Equally who,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
Compared to what I see during competitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No stigmatization of women who do gym unlike rugby for example,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mediated sport,,,,,,,,,,,,1,
Respectful,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seeing many women represented,,,,,,,,,,1,,,

Because everyone can play that sport,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
fits all,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everyone is equally welcome,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
It's a sport for everyone,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
That is not true,,,,,,,,,,,,,
More dare to come out,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think it's good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because everyone can be professional in their gymnastic career,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
For both,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
He is best known,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many women teams,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Thank you so much for your support,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a sport where you can be equally good no matter what gender you are. You are not judged by,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
There are hardly any differences,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Better comparison of performance possible. Without having to differentiate between genders,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The same in single tournaments,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
Because there was an eye on this sector and a lot of nonsense is being done and said.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Same rules,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
Less salary difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because female athletes have the same importance as male athletes.,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
That's my impression.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because the participants are not offended because of their gender.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because they compete in the same disciplines,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
FOR REASONS OF BIOLOGICAL COMPOSITION OF A MAN AND A WOMAN,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's like this,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For a long time, women have participated in gymnastics as something normal",1,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because we have them on TV all day long,,,,,,,,,,,,1,
I don't know a female cyclist,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By tradition,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many women,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
"Because they have received funding for women’s football leagues meaning more people can watch women’s football, there are also programs for young girls to get involved in football if they want to",1,,,,,,,,,,,,
Since both women and men get the same amount of attention,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
because both girls and boys have there own team in the premier league and just bc it’s football and they get dirty they still allow both genders to join in and do what they feel what’s best for them,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

there is equality between the sexes,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
"I like to look at young, fit girls, preferably topless",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Agrees with the definition,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a layman, I see the focus here on posture regardless of gender",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mixed has been around forever,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I found the others even more unfair, especially because I know the salary differences between men and women there",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the easiest way is to introduce the participation of each gender in one and the same professions,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
You just have to be able to throw and catch,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The prize money is about the same for both.,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
Because it connects black and white stars very closely,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because there is women's and men's football,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
All genders can compete regardless of who they are,,,,,,,,,,,,,
More to the sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I feel it’s often a mixed gender sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because men and women play,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Lot of ladies soccer now,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
Males ride in female races.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tv has always shown womens tennis as well as mens in championships such as Wimbledon,1,,,,,,,,,,,1,
Depends on strength,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"No special physical strength is required, what matters is skills and charm",,,1,,,,,,,,,,
It is equal,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
"There are many, both female and male tennis players who are very talented",1,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not necessarily,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Personally in my life I have seen more men in a woman's sport than all other sports.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All genders are accepted,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because it’s above all agility,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Due to the fact that gymnastics classes are only for women in schools,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,

Best,,,,,,,,,,,,,
More masculine,,,1,,,,,,,,,,
Great sport for both sexes,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
"It is for both men and women, but the vast majority of it is for men",,,,,,,,,,1,,,
is what I think,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MIXED TOURNAMENTS ARE HELD,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can bodyslam women away,,,,,,,,,,,,,
